= Prerequisites

You need at least the following:

* Gradle 5.1 or higher
+
Since the plugin makes extensive use of Gradle's provider/property API, including the new `MapProperty` added
in Gradle 5.1, earlier versions of Gradle are unfortunately not supported.

* JDK 8 or higher (for running Gradle)

* Helm CLI
+
This plugin delegates all `helm` commands to a locally installed Helm CLI. See
https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm[Installing Helm] in the Helm documentation for installation
instructions on various systems.
+
INFO: Delegating to the Helm CLI decouples the plugin release cycle from the Helm release cycle, but it also
means that some features offered by the plugin may not be available in the CLI and vice versa.
