= Configuration from Project Properties

Many settings can be configured by Gradle
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties[project properties]
instead of specifying them in the DSL. This has the advantage that you can pass them on the command line
(using `-P` switches) or a local `~/gradle.properties` file to account for different build environments.
In addition, such properties are automatically inherited by subprojects.

Some of these properties allow evaluation as a Groovy `GString`, so that you can do things like
`-Phelm.home=$buildDir/helm/home` (but the dollar signs may need to be escaped so the shell does not
treat them as environment variables).

In general, the name of the project property corresponds to the path of the property in the DSL,
e.g. `helm.home`.

NOTE: Properties set explicitly in your Gradle script have precedence over properties from the command line
or `gradle.properties` file, so it may be better to put them in `gradle.properties` in the first place, to
allow for easier overriding.
